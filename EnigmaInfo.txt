The Enigma Machine was a special machine that helped encode and decode messages for the Germans. 
This program has replicated the Enigma to the extent that is deemed possible. 
The main principle of the Enigma has been maintained, which is that a message can be encoded and 
decoded with the same initial settings and that it cannot encode a letter as itself.
